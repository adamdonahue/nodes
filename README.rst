nodes
=====

An easy-to-use graph-oriented object model for Python.

Overview
--------

Graph-oriented programming, a functional reactive model in which
changes to function inputs trigger the need for reevaluation 
of those functions, is generally a feature reserved for 
languages with strong functional programming support, particular
those that perform strong type checking and that can enforce
function purity at compile time.

This is too bad.  A graph-oriented programming model, in addition
to providing a useful model for the relationships between objects
in your system, can be an extremely productivity-enhancing
tool, freeing the developer from a lot of the coding that
would typically be needed to perform such things as memoization,
lazy evaluation, dependency tracking, subscriptions and callbacks,
temporary changes, report building, and so forth.

It doesn't have to be this way. 

A programmer can still leverage a graph-oriented model 
in a less strictly typed language as long as she adheres to the
semantics required by such a model (mainly that on-graph
functions must be pure and side-effect free).

The goal of nodes is to bridge this gap by providing Python 
developers with a simple, elegant way to put their classes
on a graph.

Features
--------

* Ease of use.
* Dependency tracking and invalidation for on-graph nodes.
* Lazy evaluation.
* Memoization.
* Change delegation.
* Contextual evaluation.  (What-if scenario building.)

Current Limitations
-------------------

* Runtime overhead.  The current version focuses on the developer interface, and 
  is not tuned for high performance.  So there is overhead
  associated with each on-graph method that will impact
  programs that require high performance.  

* Single threaded.  The graph is single threaded, and use within 
  a multiple threaded environment is not yet supported.

* No object persistence.  The graph must be constructed in memory
  each time a program is launched; there is no object persistence
  layer yet.  *This is a feature under development, namely, an
  object-oriented database of Python objects allowing one to
  save and read back on-graph objects.*

* Dynamic graph construction.  There are two approaches I could
  have taken to building the graph.  One involves using
  a AST to determine the full structure of the graph upfront.
  The other involves dynamically discovering the graph as 
  graph methods are called.

  At present I use the dynamic route, which means that 
  graph edges are added and updated as on-graph functions
  are called.  I plan to abstract the way the graph is
  discovered into a separate class and allow a user to perform
  static graph discovery vs dynamic, if desired.

  (One benefit to static discovery is that it makes it
  possible to query the graph about its relationships without
  having to had evaluated its functions, and even in that case,
  in a dynamic graph that has been evaluated with some set
  of inputs, one still doesn't necessarily get a full picture
  of the graph, but instead sees the relationships as of a 
  state in time - thatis, how the graph was used before
  the time at which you asked it for its structure.)

Using nodes: Requirements
-------------------------

Putting an object on the graph is easy, as this example
illustrates. There are three things a developer must do.

Two of these are technical:

* His class must be a subclass of GraphObject.
* On-graph methods in this class must be decorated with 
  @graphMethod.

The third is has to do with the semantics of the methods
he has decorated with @graphMethod.  All 
graph methods must be *pure and side-effect free* (with
some exceptions that we need not delve into here).

A function is *pure* if given the same inputs it returns
the same output::

    def cubed(self, x):
        return x * x * x

is a pure function, whereas::

    file.readline

is not.  

A function has *side-effects* if it modifies global state
in any way.  cubed is side-effect free, but file.readline is not,
as it would update state indicating where in the file
its next read should occur.

Purity and lack of side-effects often go hand-in-hand, and
vice-versa.


Why is purity so important?  Because without purity we cannot
know when a function's value needs to be recomputed; if that
value is determined by factors other than the inputs to
the function then we lose control over when a function needs 
to be invalidated.  And a huge benefit of the graph is
its support for automatic node invalidation,
node memoization, and lazy evaluation of node functions.

(The documentation will contain more detail on the model
used and the patterns one can leverage to perform common
operations in a graph-consistent manner.  I don't want to
get too Haskell-y on you because this is a Python module, 
not a Haskell library.)

So you may be thinking, jeez, this all sounds quite 
mathy and it sounds as if it'll be a pain to write
proper on-graph methods.

That's a fair initial reaction.  But the reality is
that developing with nodes is not that diffcult, and if you
follow its practices you end up with cleaner code
and maybe even a new way of thinking about problems.

Using nodes: An Example
-----------------------

The following example illustrates how you might use nodes
to put a simple example class on the graph.  It doesn't
cover all of nodes' features but will give you an idea
of its flavor.

The comments below indicate the status of each graph
method after a given calculation.  At this point
I'm going to switch to using the term "node" instead of
method, as in reality a method may map to multiple nodes
(for example, in the case where the method has arguments
in addition to self).

* invalid: The node is not set and the method body will run when its
  value is next requested.
* calced: The node is valid and its value was calculated by
  running the function body and memoizing the result.  As long as
  the node remains valid its memoized output will be returned with
  no recomputation required.
* set: The node was set to a specific value by the user.  This
  setting is non-contextual (global) to the graph.
* overlaid: The node was overlaid to a specific value by the user
  within a GraphContext.  The overlay is active only within the 
  context, and upon exiting the context the node's state is
  reverted to its prior value.  (This is not strictly true; if 
  global dependencies changed that were hidden by the context the
  node might have been invalidated outside the context and thus
  require computation the next time it's valid is requested.)

That said, here is the code::

    class Example(nodes.GraphObject):

        @nodes.graphMethod
        def X(self):
            return 'X:%s:%s' % (self.Y(), self.Z())
      
        @nodes.graphMethod(nodes.Settable)
        def Y(self):
            return 'Y'
             
        @nodes.graphMethod(nodes.Settable)
        def Z(self):
            return 'Z'
     
    def main():                     
        example = Example()

	# example.X             <invalid>
